# VGG19 Brain Tumor Analysis

This project implements brain tumor classification using transfer learning with the VGG19 model.

## Files
- `braintumor.py` — training and testing script
- `GUI.py` — GUI app to predict tumor type

## Dataset
Dataset folders (`Training/` and `Testing/`) are NOT included here.
Download and organize your dataset as explained in the project description.

## Usage
Train/Test model:
```bash
python braintumor.py

## Pre-trained Model

The pre-trained VGG19 model file (`final_vgg19_brain.keras`) is too large to host on GitHub.

Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nzaYZrNqu9Du8Lu2nVHTHgN6hcMaJQE/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the project folder.
